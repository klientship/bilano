                  <h6>MQL & SQL :</h6>
                  <p>
                     Many companies haven’t defined and differentiated between MQLs and SQLs because of lack of the information, or the experience needed to do it “right." In simple worlds, you can understand the basic difference between Marketing Qualified Lead and Sales Qualified Lead (MQL vs SQL) : an MQL is a visitor who is aware of their problem and SQL is the lead who knows that your product may be the solution to their problem. An MQL may not be ready to buy your product today but a SQL is a lead which can be approached by your sales team immediately.
                  </p>
                  <h6>
                     Our approach – MQLs should convert smoothly into high quality SQLs.
